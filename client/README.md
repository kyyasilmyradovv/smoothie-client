# Getting Started with Vite

This project was initialized with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in development mode. \
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. \
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. \
Vite optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. \
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

### `yarn preview`

Serves the production build locally for preview. \
This allows you to test the production build on your local machine.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: Vite doesn't have an `eject` feature like Create React App.** \
Vite is designed to be lightweight and fully customizable from the start.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Code Splitting

Vite supports code splitting out of the box. Refer to [Vite's Build documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#chunk-splitting) for details.

### Analyzing the Bundle Size

Use tools like [Bundle Analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-visualizer) to analyze your production build size.

### Making a Progressive Web App

Vite provides PWA support via plugins. Check out [Vite PWA documentation](https://vite-plugin-pwa.netlify.app/) for setup guidance.

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize your Vite project using the [Vite Configuration](https://vitejs.dev/config/) file.

### Deployment

Follow the [Vite Deployment Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for detailed instructions on deploying your application.

### `yarn build` fails to minify

If your build fails to minify, ensure that your dependencies support ES modules or use the `optimizeDeps` option in Vite to pre-bundle them. Refer to [Vite's Troubleshooting Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/dep-pre-bundling.html) for more help.
